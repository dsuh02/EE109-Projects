Edit the document below to fill in your answers to the review problems at the
end of the assignment web page.

1. (2 points) To ensure a date appears in the format: MM/DD, what snprintf()
formatting string could be used to ensure dates like 6/9 are generated in a
character buffer as 06/09.

	char buf[17];
	int m = 6; d = 9;
	snprintf(buf, 17, /* you write the format string */, m, d);

		In order to solve this issue, we should use the %02d format string 
		modifier. This will ensure that a 0 char will be outputted before the
		single digit if that is required. 


2. (1 point) Bobby Bruin wants to add a secret code to the lock where the user
can go directly from state S0 to the unlocked state S5 by pressing both buttons
at the same time.  Tammy Trojan, thinking about the execution speed of the
processor, says this can't be done, at least not reliably.  What is her reason
for thinking so?

	In order for Bobby to add this feature, they must change the code to ignore
	the rest of the if statements for checking each button every time just to 
	check if the other button is pressed every single loop. This would take too 
	much time for the small processor to compute and would produce very inconsistent 
	loops, with each one no longer taking 100ms and the 3 sec timer would also 
	be skewed.
