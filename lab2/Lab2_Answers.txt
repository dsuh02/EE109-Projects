			      EE 109 - Fall 2022
			  Lab 2 - Scopes and Signals

Edit the document below to fill your answers from the exercises done in lab.
Be sure to include the proper units, such as "1 kHz", or "200 msec"

Note: Don't use special characters like Greek "mu" or "Omega" symbols in your
answers.  These don't display correctly on Vocareum and can make it hard to
grade the answers.  For example, if you need to specify units of microseconds,
just type "microseconds" or "usecs".


1. (5 points) Fill out the following table for outputs A0 and A1. The duty
cycle of a signal is the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of the time the
signal is in the high state to the period of the signal.

    Bit  Time in 1 state   Time in 0 state    Period    Frequency    Duty cycle

    A0          ?                 ?             ?           ?            ?

    A1          ?                 ?             ?           ?            ?



2. (2 points) What is the range of the width of the A2 pulse that you observed?

    Narrowest:     ?

    Widest:        ?


3. (2 points) What is the approximate time delay from the input to the output
of the NOT gate?


4. (5 points) Fill in the table below with the input voltages to the 74HCT04
inverter and the resulting output voltage,

   Input voltage        Output voltage
        0.0                   ?
        0.2                   ?
        0.4                   ?
        0.6                   ?
        0.8                   ?
        1.0                   ?
	1.1                   ?
        1.2                   ?
	1.3                   ?
        1.4                   ?
	1.5                   ?
        1.6                   ?
        1.8                   ?
        2.0                   ?
        3.0                   ?
        4.0                   ?
        5.0                   ?



			  ---- Review Questions ----

1. (3 points) Suppose you wanted to measure the frequency of a note played by
a piano and sensed from a microphone connected/viewed on an oscilloscope.
Answer the following True/False questions with a brief explanation.

     a. True/False: To measure the frequency, the vertical scale of the
     oscilloscope would be of more use than the horizontal scale.


     b. True/False: Since the note is played for a short time period, we
     should set the triggering to "Single" rather than "Run".


     c. True/False: If the signal ranges between 0V and 2.5V, the trigger
     level should ideally be set around 1.25V.


2. (2 points) Each scope probe has a short black ground wire attached to it.
Why is it necessary to connect this to the circuit's ground point in order to
make a measurement?






3. (1 point) If you have used the Horizontal Position control to move the
trigger point horizontally so much that you can no longer see the trigger point
on the screen, what is the quick way to restore the trigger point back to the
middle of the screen?
