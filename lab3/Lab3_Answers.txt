Edit the document below to fill in your answers to the review problems at the
end of the assignment web page.

1. (2 points) Suppose we relocated the three buttons from group B, bits 5-3 to
group D, bits 5-3, noting that the LED is still attached to group D, bit
2. Assuming appropriate DDRD values, consider the following method of turning
on the LED.

    PORTD = 0x04; // turn on the LED

Explain the problem with this approach and, in particular, what would stop
working after the execution of that line of code.

	The correct way to turn on the LED is to use use the line PORTD |= 0x04;.
	The proposed line would not work because it is saying that the whole PORTD
	is set to 0x04, clearing all the bits in the whole port.




2. (2 points) Briefly explain why the delay between the press of the 'C' button
and the start of the LED on/off sequence varied when you took multiple
measurements?  Think about the timing of how software executes.

	There is a constant loop running in the main of the program and it only 
	checks for input at one point of the loop. If the button is pressed at 
	random times, the chances of the timing being the same every time is almost
	impossible because the user would be pressing the button at random points in
	the loop.
